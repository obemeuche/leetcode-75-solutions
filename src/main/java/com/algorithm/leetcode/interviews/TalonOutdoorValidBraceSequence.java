        You are given a list of strings, where each string contains only the characters (), {}, and [].
        Write a function that determines if each string is a valid sequence of braces.
        A string is considered valid if:
        Every opening brace ((, {, [) has a corresponding closing brace (), }, ]).
        Braces must close in the correct order. For example, "{[()]}" is valid but "{[}]" is not.
        Your task is to implement a function that returns a list of strings, where each entry is
        either "YES" (if the corresponding input string is valid) or "NO" (if it is not).
